# 📘 Campus Navigation & Utility Planner

The **Campus Navigation & Utility Planner** is a data-structure–based software system designed to model university buildings, manage building information using trees, and navigate campus routes using graph algorithms. This project implements **BST**, **AVL Trees**, **Graph Representations**, **Graph Traversals**, **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path**, **Kruskal’s MST**, and **Expression Trees** for energy bill evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Tree-Based Building Management
- Store building data using **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- Store balanced data using **AVL Tree**
- Perform **Inorder, Preorder, Postorder** traversals
- Search buildings efficiently
- Compare heights of BST and AVL Tree

### 🔹 Graph-Based Campus Navigation
- Represent campus using:
  - **Adjacency Matrix**
  - **Adjacency List**
- Traverse campus using:
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**

### 🔹 Path Finding & Utility Planning
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** → Shortest navigation path
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm** → Minimum-cost utility/cable layout

### 🔹 Expression Tree
- Build expression tree from postfix expressions
- Evaluate arithmetic expressions (e.g., energy bill calculations)
